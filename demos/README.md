# DOOM Demos

A set of demos used to test if everything is functioning ok:
- Some demos are from this excellent resource: http://www.classicdoom.com/odddemos.htm
- Some demos are from the compet-n and SDA archive: https://archive.org/details/competn
- The demos in [the rng-0 folder](./rng-0) are from Georges and Ã“lafur having fun playing DOOM.

Much thanks to the classic doom and doom speed demo archive community. Without their knowledge and hard work, this would have not have been possible.
