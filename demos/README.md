# DOOM tests

A set of demos used to test if everything is functioning ok.

Some demos are from this excellent resource: http://www.classicdoom.com/odddemos.htm
Some demos are from the compet-n and SDA archive: https://archive.org/details/competn

Much thanks to the classic doom and doom speed demo archive community. Without their knowledge and hard work, this would have not have been possible.
